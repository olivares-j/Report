*************** Notes for the defence *************

45 to 50 minutes.

- Keep in mind that the info is already present in the manuscript.

- Do not put tables. Minimise the number of equations.

-Check colours. Specially for colour blind people.

- Figures should have units. And I must read them.

- Make sure the graphs look good.

- Do not read!!!!!!!!!

- Reduce text to minimum!!

- Take time in each slide. Breath!

- One idea for slide.

- Speak clearly and fluent.

***************** TIME *************
40% in the methodology (2 slides top for code development)
30% in the results (including synthetic data)
10% in current limitations and future work:
	- GPU
	- Binaries
	- Extinction
20% in Introduction:
  - Context
  - The pleiades, why?
  - Current methodologies. How they fail?
  - How I plan to solve it?

************** Answers to referees *******
- Answers must be implicit in the presentation.


************** Specifics ***********
- Explain why some graphs have empty gaussians.

- Monotonicity. Answer stefano.

- make clear the problem of multidimensional incompleteness.

- Mention that astronomy is an observational science. Therefore there is no random sample.

- We cannot include the selection effects! 

- The BHM allows to marginalise and include magnitude limits.

- mass segregation

- poisson uncertainties.

-current incompleteness will disappear in future data sets.


************************************ TED ****************************************
- Tell something new: The BHM is new why? give reasons to the audience.
		- Correctly propagating uncertainties from all observables.
			Never before uncertainties in proper motions were in the MF.
			Never before a data set to construct the model have been this big.
			Never before objects with missing values have been used to construct a model.
			Never before a BHM in stellar clusters.
			Never before a posterior probability for a membership probability.

		- What is new in the hierarchical approach?
			Inferring prior from the data
			Allows to marginalise unknown parameters and obtain their global properties.


- Be contagious about the use of these new things. 
		- The BHM was developed in the 60’s but people could not use it because it was computationally demanding.
		- With new computers we suddenly have BHM every where. Health, biology, artificial vision.
		- Model selection. Compare and chose in an objective way.

- Express your feeling. How complicate was at the beginning. How difficult was to learn statistics from scratch.
		- Tell your past about statistics.
		- Tell them that it was not easy to deal with programming languages, computers, clusters, mcmc, pso, convergence,
		- Tell them that slowly you started to gain trust in yourself. and then started to experiment. to search for what other have done before.
		- Tell them how cool is to pass knowledge from one area to the other. 
		- Tell them how difficult is to convince others.

		- Idea with a personal story at the centre. 
		- Be contagious about your excitement for astronomy.
		- Tell them about yourself. How deep you wanted to prepared for gaia. How when you where searching for a PhD Coryn rejected you,
		   and now he says your work is very good. I do not know where to say this.
		- Be yourself, not what others want you to be. Be fun, as you are, naturally. Do not force it.

- Start on something compelling and interesting.

- Focus in. One idea simply expressed instead of several non communicated. Be effective. You want to communicate. A talk is to communicate ideas. Take time, be sure the audience gets, catch, understand the idea.

————————
- How do you  want to change your audience by the end of the presentation?
- What do you want to communicate?
I want them to understand the importance of “better” modelling your data. 
What is better?
—— Bayasian.
—- Hierarchical.
— heteroscedastic.
— missing values.

What is your goal?

Achievable goal

Where do you want them to be.

Do an inception!…. plant an idea in someones mind!
They must embrace it and strategically take action.

You have to transmit your beliefs.

The goal must be there every time, and you must think of during the entire presentation.
Every ting you must be focus towards your goal.
——————————
- Tell a story.
——Convey your ideas into a story.

— First act: the hero: the idea: the Bayesian formalism with the hierarchical structure.
—— friends of my hero: heteroscedastic data. missing values.
—- Nemesis: computing time, contamination, 
- Encounters road blocks: the construction of the model, the computing time, the different clusters, 
- Hero emerges triunfant -> provides the results.


First. What it is now: The state of the art. the previous methods.
       What it could be: the perfect ideal world. Contrast everything done by previous works.

Second. Move back and fort showing what is what it could be, what is what it could be. and catch them.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
- Remove slides
- Keep the pace
- Step back from the details:
	- Talk less of missing values
	- More on the results
- Shrink state of the art.
- Be synthetic on the works of others.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Slide title name 
- Why study clusters?
- Global properties: 
- Why do we need?
- Dynamical evolution
- Mass function? -> Key property
- Evolution defined by the mass function
- 
——————————————
Simplify the message and put image together with bigger labels.
Mention the observables

—remove ideal vs reality
—————————————
Codes:
What they do not address?
Mention the caveats more the codes in the last few years.
This was as enormous effort but where where thinks not achieved this is why we start.
———————
- remove Approaching the ideal and describe what you plan to address.
——————————————
Strategy.
Develop a new tool
Pleiades: benchmarking pretty well now.
Point one: Create a tool based on the best methodology.
Why we go bayesian
Frame on the COSMIC DANCe- tool fully expolteid in the future.

4 Evaluation and validataion
5 Discussion on the results.
—————————————————
DATA sets
too much slides
keep slides for the discussion.
merge slides Dec vs i mag and K mag
———
Explain why we did RDDR2
What that implies.
-explain the axes of each plot.
———
selection of observables
remove selection models for the spatial distribution (move it to the future aspects)
—— we did not include the positions because we did not want to bias the result with bad model
——
Remove equations:
- Bayes theorem.
- Plate notation.
——————
Treatment of missing information
- mention that assumptions are simple but are better than previous
- I have slides preparad to prove that this assumptions are indeed better.
——
Ignorability vs Naivety - > move to questions
Remove the numbers 
and explain
——

TILTES HAVE TO BE MORE INFORMATIVE
BEFORE INT HE LITERATURE

OVERVIEW of the cluster —— move to the beginning to the presentation.

—— merge overview of cluster and field together.

——————
colour index-
resume the discussion

—— remove slide 34 faherty. to better constrain the spline.
— remove hillebrand 2008
————
Validation remove equation
describe texts and explain that the optimum was chose objectively.
———
Explain the acronyms
and put two graphs together
change colour commons
—comparison with hervé change names
——Rebull remove it
——put results on probability before the comparison.
put binaries in answering questions
—TILTES MORE EXPLICIT IN THE RESULTS
—————m
mass distribution
- remove prior and add jh
