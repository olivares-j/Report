*************** Notes for the defence *************

45 to 50 minutes.

- Keep in mind that the info is already present in the manuscript.

- Do not put tables. Minimise the number of equations.

-Check colours. Specially for colour blind people.

- Figures should have units. And I must read them.

- Make sure the graphs look good.

- Do not read!!!!!!!!!

- Reduce text to minimum!!

- Take time in each slide. Breath!

- One idea for slide.

- Speak clearly and fluent.

***************** TIME *************
40% in the methodology (2 slides top for code development)
30% in the results (including synthetic data)
10% in current limitations and future work:
	- GPU
	- Binaries
	- Extinction
20% in Introduction:
  - Context
  - The pleiades, why?
  - Current methodologies. How they fail?
  - How I plan to solve it?

************** Answers to referees *******
- Answers must be implicit in the presentation.


************** Specifics ***********
- Explain why some graphs have empty gaussians.

- Monotonicity. Answer stefano.

- make clear the problem of multidimensional incompleteness.

- Mention that astronomy is an observational science. Therefore there is no random sample.

- We cannot include the selection effects! 

- The BHM allows to marginalise and include magnitude limits.

- mass segregation

- poisson uncertainties.

-current incompleteness will disappear in future data sets.
