    abstract = { When fitting hierarchical regression models, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation has computational (and, for some users, philosophical) advantages compared to full Bayesian inference, but when the number of groups is small, estimates of the covariance matrix (Σ) of group-level varying coefficients are often degenerate. One can do better, even from a purely point estimation perspective, by using a prior distribution or penalty function. In this article, we use Bayes modal estimation to obtain positive definite covariance matrix estimates. We recommend a class of Wishart (not inverse-Wishart) priors for Σ with a default choice of hyperparameters, that is, the degrees of freedom are set equal to the number of varying coefficients plus 2, and the scale matrix is the identity matrix multiplied by a value that is large relative to the scale of the problem. This prior is equivalent to independent gamma priors for the eigenvalues of Σ with shape parameter 1.5 and rate parameter close to 0. It is also equivalent to independent gamma priors for the variances with the same hyperparameters multiplied by a function of the correlation coefficients. With this default prior, the posterior mode for Σ is always strictly positive definite. Furthermore, the resulting uncertainty for the fixed coefficients is less underestimated than under classical ML or restricted maximum likelihood estimation. We also suggest an extension of our method that can be used when stronger prior information is available for some of the variances or correlations. }

  Abstract = { Two new stochastic search methods are proposed for optimizing the knot locations and/or smoothing parameters for least-squares or penalized splines. One of the methods is a golden-section-augmented blind search, while the other is a continuous genetic algorithm. Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the algorithms are very successful at producing knot locations and/or smoothing parameters that are near optimal in a squared error sense. Both algorithms are amenable to parallelization and have been implemented in OpenMP and MPI. An adjusted GCV criterion is also considered for selecting both the number and location of knots. The method performed well relative to MARS in a small empirical comparison. },

@article{Ozerov2013,
  Abstract = {We consider the problem of acoustic modeling of noisy speech data, where the uncertainty over the data is given by a Gaussian distribution. While this uncertainty has been exploited at the decoding stage via uncertainty decoding, its usage at the training stage remains limited to static model adaptation. We introduce a new expectation maximization (EM) based technique, which we call uncertainty training, that allows us to train Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) or hidden Markov models (HMMs) directly from noisy data with dynamic uncertainty. We evaluate the potential of this technique for a GMM-based speaker recognition task on speech data corrupted by real-world domestic background noise, using a state-of-the-art signal enhancement technique and various uncertainty estimation techniques as a front-end. Compared to conventional training, the proposed training algorithm results in 3--4% absolute improvement in speaker recognition accuracy by training from either matched, unmatched or multi-condition noisy data. This algorithm is also applicable with minor modifications to maximum a posteriori (MAP) or maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) acoustic model adaptation from noisy data and to other data than audio. },

@article{Gong2016,
  Abstract = { A current challenge for many Bayesian analyses is determining when to terminate high-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. To this end, we propose using an automated sequential stopping procedure that terminates the simulation when the computational uncertainty is small relative to the posterior uncertainty. Further, we show this stopping rule is equivalent to stopping when the effective sample size is sufficiently large. Such a stopping rule has previously been shown to work well in settings with posteriors of moderate dimension. In this article, we illustrate its utility in high-dimensional simulations while overcoming some current computational issues. As examples, we consider two complex Bayesian analyses on spatially and temporally correlated datasets. The first involves a dynamic space-time model on weather station data and the second a spatial variable selection model on fMRI brain imaging data. Our results show the sequential stopping rule is easy to implement, provides uncertainty estimates, and performs well in high-dimensional settings. Supplementary materials for this article are available online. },

@article{Akeret2013,
  Abstract = {We study the benefits and limits of parallelised Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in cosmology. MCMC methods are widely used for the estimation of cosmological parameters from a given set of observations and are typically based on the Metropolis?Hastings algorithm. Some of the required calculations can however be computationally intensive, meaning that a single long chain can take several hours or days to calculate. In practice, this can be limiting, since the MCMC process needs to be performed many times to test the impact of possible systematics and to understand the robustness of the measurements being made. To achieve greater speed through parallelisation, MCMC algorithms need to have short autocorrelation times and minimal overheads caused by tuning and burn-in. The resulting scalability is hence influenced by two factors, the MCMC overheads and the parallelisation costs. In order to efficiently distribute the MCMC sampling over thousands of cores on modern cloud computing infrastructure, we developed a Python framework called CosmoHammer  which embeds emcee, an implementation by Foreman-Mackey et al. (2012) of the affine invariant ensemble sampler by Goodman and Weare (2010). We test the performance of CosmoHammer for cosmological parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data. While Metropolis?Hastings is dominated by overheads, CosmoHammer is able to accelerate the sampling process from a wall time of 30 h on a dual core notebook to 16 min by scaling out to 2048 cores. Such short wall times for complex datasets open possibilities for extensive model testing and control of systematics.},

@article{Foreman2013,
  Abstract = {ABSTRACT.We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman {\&} Weare (2010). The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ?N2?N2 for a traditional algorithm in an NN-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public License v2.},

@article{Sarro2014,
  Abstract = {We present a new technique designed to take full advantage of the high dimensionality (photometric, astrometric, temporal) of the DANCe survey to derive self-consistent and robust membership probabilities of the Pleiades cluster. We aim at developing a methodology to infer membership probabilities to the Pleiades cluster from the DANCe multidimensional astro-photometric data set in a consistent way throughout the entire derivation. The determination of the membership probabilities has to be applicable to censored data and must incorporate the measurement uncertainties into the inference procedure. We use Bayes' theorem and a curvilinear forward model for the likelihood of the measurements of cluster members in the colour-magnitude space, to infer posterior membership probabilities. The distribution of the cluster members proper motions and the distribution of contaminants in the full multidimensional astro-photometric space is modelled with a mixture-of-Gaussians likelihood. We analyse several representation spaces composed of the proper motions plus a subset of the available magnitudes and colour indices. We select two prominent representation spaces composed of variables selected using feature relevance determination techniques based in Random Forests, and analyse the resulting samples of high probability candidates. We consistently find lists of high probability (p > 0.9975) candidates with {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 1000 sources, 4 to 5 times more than obtained in the most recent astro-photometric studies of the cluster. The methodology presented here is ready for application in data sets that include more dimensions, such as radial and/or rotational velocities, spectral indices and variability.},
