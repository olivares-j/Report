   abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

There are no discretization errors even for large step sizes. The method is especially efficient for systems such as quantum chromodynamics which contain fermionic degrees of freedom. Detailed results are presented for four-dimensional compact quantum electrodynamics including the dynamical effects of electrons.},

first application of this method to data. In the first approach, we
sample the joint posterior distribution of the shear maps and power
spectra by Gibbs sampling, with minimal model assumptions. In the second
approach, we sample the joint posterior of the shear maps and
cosmological parameters, providing a new, accurate and principled
approach to cosmological parameter inference from cosmic shear data. As
a first demonstration on data, we perform a two-bin tomographic analysis
to constrain cosmological parameters and investigate the possibility of
photometric redshift bias in the CFHTLenS data. Under the baseline
{$\Lambda$}CDM ({$\Lambda$} cold dark matter) model, we constrain S\_8 =
{$\sigma$} \_8({$\Omega$} \_m/0.3)\^{}$\{$0.5$\}$ = 0.67$^{+0.03}$$_{-0.03}$
(68 per cent), consistent with previous CFHTLenS analyses but in tension
with Planck. Adding neutrino mass as a free parameter, we are able to
constrain {\sum}m$_{ν}$ $\lt$ 4.6 eV (95 per cent) using CFHTLenS
data alone. Including a linear redshift-dependent photo-z bias {$\Delta$}z
= p$_{2}$(z - p$_{1}$), we find
p\_1=-0.25$^{+0.53}$$_{-0.60}$ and p\_2 =
-0.15$^{+0.17}$$_{-0.15}$, and tension with Planck is only
alleviated under very conservative prior assumptions. Neither the
non-minimal neutrino mass nor photo-z bias models are significantly
preferred by the CFHTLenS (two-bin tomography) data.

parameter of SNIa peak optical brightness, as measured by the standard
SALT2 parameter m$_{B}$. We use BAHAMAS, a Bayesian hierarchical
model for SNIa cosmology, to estimate the residual scatter in the Hubble
diagram. We find that in the absence of a colour correction,
t$_{2}$ is a better standardization parameter compared to stretch:
t$_{2}$ has a 1{$\sigma$} posterior interval for the Hubble residual
scatter of {$\sigma$}$_{Δμ}$ = $\{$0.250, 0.257$\}$ mag, compared
to {$\sigma$}$_{Δμ}$ = $\{$0.280, 0.287$\}$ mag when stretch
(x$_{1}$) alone is used. We demonstrate that when employed
together with a colour correction, t$_{2}$ and stretch lead to
similar residual scatter. Using colour, stretch and t$_{2}$
jointly as standardization parameters does not result in any further
reduction in scatter, suggesting that t$_{2}$ carries redundant
information with respect to stretch and colour. With a much larger SNIa
NIR sample at higher redshift in the future, t$_{2}$ could be a
useful quantity to perform robustness checks of the standardization
procedure.

mapped the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at sufficient resolution

hierarchical model for the lensed CMB in terms of the unlensed CMB and
the lensing potential. So far there has been no feasible algorithm for
inferring the posterior distribution of the lensing potential from the
lensed CMB map. We propose a solution that allows efficient Markov Chain
Monte Carlo sampling from the joint posterior of the lensing potential
and the unlensed CMB map using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo technique.
The main conceptual step in the solution is a re-parameterization of CMB
lensing in terms of the lensed CMB and the {\ldquo}inverse lensing{\rdquo}
potential. We demonstrate a fast implementation on simulated data,
including noise and a sky cut, that uses a further acceleration based on
a very mild approximation of the inverse lensing potential. We find that
the resulting Markov Chain has short correlation lengths and excellent
convergence properties, making it promising for applications to
high-resolution CMB data sets in the future.

SALT-II technique, in which we treat the statistical errors but not the
systematic errors. The standard {$\chi$}$^{2}$ methodology and the
recently proposed SNeIa Bayesian hierarchical method (SNBHM) are each
applied to identical sets of simulations based on the 3-yr data release
from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3), and also data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, the low-redshift sample and the Hubble Space
Telescope, assuming a concordance {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter cosmology.
For both methods, we find that the recovered values of the cosmological
parameters, and the global nuisance parameters controlling the stretch
and colour corrections to the supernovae light curves, suffer from small
biases. The magnitude of the biases is similar in both cases, with the
SNBHM yielding slightly more accurate results for cosmological
parameters when applied to just the SNLS3 single survey data sets. Most
notably, in this case, the biases in the recovered matter density
{$\Omega$}$_{m,0}$ are in opposite directions for the two methods.
For any given realization of the SNLS3-type data, this can result in a
{\tilde}2{$\sigma$} discrepancy in the estimated value of
{$\Omega$}$_{m,0}$ between the two methods, which we find to be the
case for real SNLS3 data. As more higher and lower redshift SNIa samples
are included, however, the cosmological parameter estimates of the two
methods converge.

@article{Chung2015,
  Abstract = { When fitting hierarchical regression models, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation has computational (and, for some users, philosophical) advantages compared to full Bayesian inference, but when the number of groups is small, estimates of the covariance matrix (Σ) of group-level varying coefficients are often degenerate. One can do better, even from a purely point estimation perspective, by using a prior distribution or penalty function. In this article, we use Bayes modal estimation to obtain positive definite covariance matrix estimates. We recommend a class of Wishart (not inverse-Wishart) priors for Σ with a default choice of hyperparameters, that is, the degrees of freedom are set equal to the number of varying coefficients plus 2, and the scale matrix is the identity matrix multiplied by a value that is large relative to the scale of the problem. This prior is equivalent to independent gamma priors for the eigenvalues of Σ with shape parameter 1.5 and rate parameter close to 0. It is also equivalent to independent gamma priors for the variances with the same hyperparameters multiplied by a function of the correlation coefficients. With this default prior, the posterior mode for Σ is always strictly positive definite. Furthermore, the resulting uncertainty for the fixed coefficients is less underestimated than under classical ML or restricted maximum likelihood estimation. We also suggest an extension of our method that can be used when stronger prior information is available for some of the variances or correlations. },

  Abstract = { Two new stochastic search methods are proposed for optimizing the knot locations and/or smoothing parameters for least-squares or penalized splines. One of the methods is a golden-section-augmented blind search, while the other is a continuous genetic algorithm. Monte Carlo experiments indicate that the algorithms are very successful at producing knot locations and/or smoothing parameters that are near optimal in a squared error sense. Both algorithms are amenable to parallelization and have been implemented in OpenMP and MPI. An adjusted GCV criterion is also considered for selecting both the number and location of knots. The method performed well relative to MARS in a small empirical comparison. },

@article{Ozerov2013,
  Abstract = {We consider the problem of acoustic modeling of noisy speech data, where the uncertainty over the data is given by a Gaussian distribution. While this uncertainty has been exploited at the decoding stage via uncertainty decoding, its usage at the training stage remains limited to static model adaptation. We introduce a new expectation maximization (EM) based technique, which we call uncertainty training, that allows us to train Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) or hidden Markov models (HMMs) directly from noisy data with dynamic uncertainty. We evaluate the potential of this technique for a GMM-based speaker recognition task on speech data corrupted by real-world domestic background noise, using a state-of-the-art signal enhancement technique and various uncertainty estimation techniques as a front-end. Compared to conventional training, the proposed training algorithm results in 3--4% absolute improvement in speaker recognition accuracy by training from either matched, unmatched or multi-condition noisy data. This algorithm is also applicable with minor modifications to maximum a posteriori (MAP) or maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) acoustic model adaptation from noisy data and to other data than audio. },

  Abstract = { A current challenge for many Bayesian analyses is determining when to terminate high-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. To this end, we propose using an automated sequential stopping procedure that terminates the simulation when the computational uncertainty is small relative to the posterior uncertainty. Further, we show this stopping rule is equivalent to stopping when the effective sample size is sufficiently large. Such a stopping rule has previously been shown to work well in settings with posteriors of moderate dimension. In this article, we illustrate its utility in high-dimensional simulations while overcoming some current computational issues. As examples, we consider two complex Bayesian analyses on spatially and temporally correlated datasets. The first involves a dynamic space-time model on weather station data and the second a spatial variable selection model on fMRI brain imaging data. Our results show the sequential stopping rule is easy to implement, provides uncertainty estimates, and performs well in high-dimensional settings.

@article{Akeret2013,
  Abstract = {We study the benefits and limits of parallelised Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling in cosmology. MCMC methods are widely used for the estimation of cosmological parameters from a given set of observations and are typically based on the Metropolis?Hastings algorithm. Some of the required calculations can however be computationally intensive, meaning that a single long chain can take several hours or days to calculate. In practice, this can be limiting, since the MCMC process needs to be performed many times to test the impact of possible systematics and to understand the robustness of the measurements being made. To achieve greater speed through parallelisation, MCMC algorithms need to have short autocorrelation times and minimal overheads caused by tuning and burn-in. The resulting scalability is hence influenced by two factors, the MCMC overheads and the parallelisation costs. In order to efficiently distribute the MCMC sampling over thousands of cores on modern cloud computing infrastructure, we developed a Python framework called CosmoHammer  which embeds emcee, an implementation by Foreman-Mackey et al. (2012) of the affine invariant ensemble sampler by Goodman and Weare (2010). We test the performance of CosmoHammer for cosmological parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data. While Metropolis?Hastings is dominated by overheads, CosmoHammer is able to accelerate the sampling process from a wall time of 30 h on a dual core notebook to 16 min by scaling out to 2048 cores. Such short wall times for complex datasets open possibilities for extensive model testing and control of systematics.},

  Abstract = {ABSTRACT.We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman {\&} Weare (2010). The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ?N2?N2 for a traditional algorithm in an NN-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort. The code is available online at http://dan.iel.fm/emcee under the GNU General Public License v2.},

  Abstract = {We present a new technique designed to take full advantage of the high dimensionality (photometric, astrometric, temporal) of the DANCe survey to derive self-consistent and robust membership probabilities of the Pleiades cluster. We aim at developing a methodology to infer membership probabilities to the Pleiades cluster from the DANCe multidimensional astro-photometric data set in a consistent way throughout the entire derivation. The determination of the membership probabilities has to be applicable to censored data and must incorporate the measurement uncertainties into the inference procedure. We use Bayes' theorem and a curvilinear forward model for the likelihood of the measurements of cluster members in the colour-magnitude space, to infer posterior membership probabilities. The distribution of the cluster members proper motions and the distribution of contaminants in the full multidimensional astro-photometric space is modelled with a mixture-of-Gaussians likelihood. We analyse several representation spaces composed of the proper motions plus a subset of the available magnitudes and colour indices. We select two prominent representation spaces composed of variables selected using feature relevance determination techniques based in Random Forests, and analyse the resulting samples of high probability candidates. We consistently find lists of high probability (p > 0.9975) candidates with {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 1000 sources, 4 to 5 times more than obtained in the most recent astro-photometric studies of the cluster. The methodology presented here is ready for application in data sets that include more dimensions, such as radial and/or rotational velocities, spectral indices and variability.},
