{\LARGE Abstract OutReach}

The origin and evolution of stars is one of the greatest challenges in modern astrophysics. Today, it is known that the vast majority stars form in stellar clusters, which its majority dissolves after a few hundred million years. Therefore, studying them in these early ages is essential to understand the origin and evolution of stars. 

The objective of this work is the statistical analysis of the probability density functions (PDFs) of the cluster population. To attain it, a new statistical tool is created and benchmarked in the Pleiades open cluster data. It learns the parameters of the PDFs from the data. Particularly those of the positions, angular velocities (both measured in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight), and brightness of the cluster stars. Results are in general agreement with those of the literature. Furthermore, it discovers $\sim200$ new candidate members, which represents 10\% of the cluster stars.
